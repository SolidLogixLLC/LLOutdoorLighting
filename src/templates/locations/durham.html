                        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and
                        typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                        industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
                        when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
                        scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has
                        survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
                        electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
                        It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
                        Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and
                        more recently with desktop publishing software like
                        Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.is a
                        long established fact that a reader will be distracted
                        by the readable content of a page when looking at its
                        layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a
                        more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed
                        to using 'Content here, content here', making it look
                        like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages
                        and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their
                        default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will
                        uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various
                        versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by
                        accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the
                        like).

                          and construction work can undermine the foundations
                          and integrity of your entire home. If you don't want
                          to call a professional, can you be sure to do a
                          responsible job for your home's structural integrity
                          and the health and safety of yourself and your family?

                        <li>
                          <strong> 2. </strong> When it comes to
                          <strong>removing walls</strong> and making structural
                          changes to your home, it is best to get a professional
                          and not begin swinging the sledgehammer yourself.

                        <li>
                          <strong> 3. </strong> As a homeowner,
                          <strong>replacing your roof</strong> is one of the
                          most significant investments you will make in your
                          home, and it is also the most expensive. Up there,
                          roofing is a delicate and arduous task that can take a
                          long time. That is why regular inspections and roof
                          maintenance are so necessary, as they can help you get
                          the most out of your current roof before it's time to
                          buy a new one and prevent problems before they occur.

                          <strong> 4. </strong> Last but not least,
                          <strong>Electrical repairs</strong> are probably the
                          most dangerous a non-professional can attempt. They
                          can come at you sideways too. Of course, as a
                          professional, you always see and hear stories of the
                          strange predicaments that clients create when they go
                          it alone. One story I can tell is about a client who
                          called after her husband tried a plumbing repair. He
                          dug a hole in his front yard and began a repair near
                          the water main, not knowing electrical cables were
                          next to the pipes. The client said she looked out the
                          window and saw sparks coming from the hole.
                          Fortunately, her husband had gotten out of the hole
                          before the water seepage reached the frayed electrical
                          cable. Of course, both plumbing and electrical repairs
                          had to be completed by professionals.
